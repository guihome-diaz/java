chinese.zodiac.pig.description=Pigs are models of sincerity, purity, tolerance, and honor. When you first meet them, Pigs seem too good to be true. They are careful and caring, obliging and chivalrous. Put your trust in them, they won't let you down and they will never try to.<br>The Pigs simply want to do everything right. Pigs are the people everyone admires most. Make a list of the Pigs in your life: aren't they the nicest, most loving and scrupulously caring people around?<br>Pigs are born to give, to yield and to serve. Frankly speaking, most people take advantage of this Pig nature. Also, not only are Pigs easy to fool, they like it that way too. No matter how old they get, Pig people still only see and believe that all men/women are basically good.<br>Pig people constantly sacrifice their own happiness and comfort for the sake of somebody else. The Pig is a splendid companion. If you have a lifetime Pig friend, don't think that your worries are over.<br>Pigs are loyal, faithful and giving - only as long as they approve of you. In order to keep your lifetime Piggy friend, remember, never try to force your opinions on a Pig - a Pig rarely asks for help and cannot graciously accept it.<br>The Pig doesn't say much - but when they do decide to speak, suddenly, nothing can stop them until they run out of subjects.<br>Like the Monkey, the Pig is intellectual - a character with a great thirst for knowledge. Some people claim that Pigs are snobbish. Manners, breeding and good taste are of enormous importance to them. In fact, pigs are aesthetic.<br>Pigs are born with an excellent nose for style in everything. Food is another of Piggy's little sins. Pigs adore food, and after-dinner chocolates. The Pig often over-eats, but they eat with good taste.<br>In relationship, Pig people are sensitive, sweet but naive, and caring. They are romantic and certainly are the marriage-type. But on the other hand, Pigs are also possessive, jealous and exclusive. <br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.chinese-astrology.co.uk/pig.html">http://www.chinese-astrology.co.uk/pig.html</a>
chinese.zodiac.rat.name=Rat
chinese.zodiac.rat.description=Rat people are born under the sign of charm and aggressiveness. They are expressive and can be talkative sometimes. They like to go to parties and usually spend quite some time chatting with their friends. Although the Rat can be quiet sometime, it is rare to catch a Rat sitting quietly.<br>Rat people usually have more acquaintances than real friends and they revere and cherish those close to them. Once you become their real friends, they will treat you as their family. Rats are self-contained and keep problems to themselves. And even though they can be talkative sometimes, they never confide in anyone. Sometimes mean, narrow-minded and suburban in outlook, Rat people are nevertheless honest.<br>They can always make a success of their lives as long as they manage to master their perpetual discontent and their insistence on living for the present moment. The Rat is quick-witted. Most rats get more accomplished in 24 hours than the rest of us do in as many days.<br>They are confident and usually have good instinct. Stubborn as they are, they prefer to live by their own rules rather others. It won't be an easy task to work with Rat people, why? Simple, because they are also 100% perfectionists. They are very organized and talented, perhaps that is why the Rat makes a good businessman or politician.<br>Unfortunately, as soon as the Rat earns money, they spend it. Maybe that explains why the Rat is so careful when they lend money to others. If you ever borrow money from the Rat, don't be surprised by the high-interests.<br>The Rat is not romantic, but they are sensual and loving. Rat people could be hard to see through at first glance, because they are also very protective, but even though they are not easy but they are worth it - ask anyone who has a Rat for a lover, parent, child or friend. They are very loyal and devoting to their families. <br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.chinese-astrology.co.uk/rat.html">http://www.chinese-astrology.co.uk/rat.html</a>
